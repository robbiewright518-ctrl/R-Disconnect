# R-Disconnect
Tracks every player’s location server-side and remembers their last position before a drop.

When someone leaves, it instantly renders a floating 3D notification in-world at the exact spot, showing their ID and disconnect reason.

Text auto-wraps, scales, and sits on top of a translucent background for readability at any distance.

Includes smart distance culling and long display duration so staff can review the scene after the fact.

Fully standalone: no framework requirements, just plug into any FiveM server running the Cerulean build.
